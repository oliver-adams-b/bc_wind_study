That week, there was a hurricane in the USA that hit the east coast (hurricane Florence : https://www.google.com/search?q=ouragan+florence+2018&rlz=1C5CHFA_enCA903CA904&sxsrf=ALeKk03_pGj49Pm-OHcXOz60qXYVYD0JqA:1591917588406&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=nPkNfkij6DIwFM%253A%252CHt3NijmJYzKI7M%252C_&vet=1&usg=AI4_-kTzy4EMv-1NjlpzD1tuPtpOL7EJwg&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiM1fiS8_rpAhVsQzABHRRdAHIQ_h0wFHoECA0QBQ&biw=1623&bih=865#imgrc=i59d286m5Fr9uM).

That hurricane brought winds from the south with powerful strenght. They were exactly perpendicular with the line, which made the situation much worse. 

Also, the bowl of the mine creates some kind of vortex, that accelerates the wind speed. At the bottom of the mine, there is no wind. But it seems like in the middle (where the webbing hangs, with about 60-100 meter sag), the wind is the strongest - this is an observation, an assumption. The webbing was upsagging on 1900 meters : pretty impressive, scary and sad at the same time. ","1. The tapes all broke and the main and backup started oscillating. 
2a. With the abrasion caused by the oscillation, one 50m section was cut. The tension was now on that backup section. 
or (hard to tell what happened first)
2b. The main line was cut directly at the anchor. The main and backup passed through a kootenay carriage that was attached to an anchor post. This post was used as an A frame. The main and backup were padded, but with the oscillation, they went unprotected. Then with the abrasion in the kootenay, this first mainline section was cut. 

During this time, with the main line breaking, the dynamometer got a back shock and smashed onto the anchor concrete blocks. The last measure we had was 20kN. 

3. Then, this first main line section that was cut got tangled and wrapped around the connection 50 meters away. This caused a second section of 50 meter to snap. 

4. This happened multiple times (5-10 times) until we knew that without our action, the line would simply snap it's way to the other anchor. ",We decided that we needed to cut the line in order to protect as much of the webbing as possible. ,,1,Both,1,1,Cut,0,1,1,1,0,0
