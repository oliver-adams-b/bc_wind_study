# Using the Elastic Catenary Equation to Estimate Forces on Highline Anchors Due to Wind

Using data from Phillip Queen's ISA wind study, and a dictionary of the mechanical properties of BC's webbing arsenal, we estimate the theoretical "danger zone" for wind speed versus line length. The approximation is simple, and shouldn't be taken as concrete fact, but the theoretical boundary does coincide well with the real-world data collected from the ISA.
